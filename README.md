# Scalene-Web-Browser or Scalene

# Tutorial
When the system is launched, you will type in the bar at the top, you MUST click search, you cant press enter, sorry.
I recommend searching up Google.com then using that to search for info and etc.

#Some stuff
Scalene does work with youtube, but not flash things like animal jam, or slither.io
Or for my friends from Scratch.mit.edu, it prevents pop ups somehow, and you can click see inside, but you can click create!


#Rights
The Scalene Web Browser is a browser made by Ethan Perron or Scaleneparkour, there was no other contributors!
